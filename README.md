# DTR-Specfile-Generator
This repo is for generating random specfiles that can be used by the [decentralized-tech-radar_dev](https://github.com/Agile-Arch-Angels/decentralized-tech-radar_dev) project for testing as well as testing feting specfiles from GitHub repos.  
The format for the specfile is specified [here](https://github.com/Agile-Arch-Angels/decentralized-tech-radar_dev/blob/main/docs/user_docs/spec_file_format.md)
